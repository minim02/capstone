        This section showcases my creative writing work throughout the Professional Writing program. 
        It includes chapbooks, story excerpts, and revised pieces, highlighting both my creative experimentation and revision process.
        Each piece demonstrates growth in voice, structure, and audience awareness, as well as exploration of multimodal and digital composition.

      <h3>Chapbooks</h3>
      <p>While in college, I have created two chapbooks of poems. This gave me a great chance to revise and create new work to add into the new chapbook collection. These chapbooks are embeded below, along with a reflection of revision.</p>
      <h3>Chromatic Fragments</h3>

  <h3>Chapbook Comparison</h3>

  <p>
    I created two chapbooks over the span of a year: Chromatic Fragments and Anatomy of Stillness. Chromatic Fragments was my first attempt at a highly personal, fragmented poetic style, exploring selfhood, memory, and emotional vulnerability. While it successfully captured intimate moments, I realized that the structure sometimes felt disjointed, making it challenging for readers to follow a throughline.
When I created Anatomy of Stillness about a year later, I intentionally focused on improving cohesion, clarity, and thematic flow while retaining the vulnerability and imagery I valued. I structured the collection to guide the reader more smoothly through introspection, sensory experience, and relational awareness. I also refined my use of imagery, balancing metaphorical abstraction with accessibility. Yancey (n.d.) influenced my focus on preserving authentic voice while ensuring readability.
The table below summarizes the main differences between the two chapbooks and the improvements I made:

    <!-- Story Excerpt -->
    <section class="bib-source">
      <h3>Story Excerpt</h3>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This excerpt is from a short story called Call of the Sea, focusing on a young woman and her connection to the sea, thwarted by accidental pregnancy. Minimal revision was done to preserve original voice and key imagery.</p>
      <div class="story-excerpt">
        <p>She always wanted to be a part of the sea. Ever since she was a little girl, she learned all there was to know about the ocean. Her parents took her to aquariums, where she pointed at fins and sleek bodies with her grubby fingers. She replicated the movements of these creatures in her daily baths, stopping only when her mother scolded her over the soaking wet floors.</p>
        <p>She would plunge her head into the water, going past the porcelain walls and into the deep icy waters below. There she swam for as long as she could, until an aching burn in her chest made her break through to the surface, taking in long breaths of air. She could never fully explain what it was about the sea that drew her to it. There was something about the way creatures floated through the water, like ethereal beings. The gentle grasp of water surrounding them entirely as they drifted through it was so beautiful, so freeing.</p>
        <p>Her obsession grew with her, manifesting through deep sea documentaries and themed birthday parties. When teachers began asking what she wanted to be when she grew up, she had the same answer every time: <strong>Marine biologist.</strong></p>
        <p>She almost got there, that is, before Jamie. He was one year her senior, studying finance, which she was positively atrocious at. She couldn’t help noticing his soft blue eyes, striking like diamonds when light hit his face. She began seeing those eyes everywhere, in class, in the movies she watched, in the creatures she loved so dearly. She didn’t get close to those eyes until they approached her, and she slowly stepped into their gaze. Her questions on the notes turned into study sessions, and it wasn’t long before the study sessions turned into two pink lines on a little white stick.</p>
        <p>Her parents were less than enthused, seeing their daughter come home from college with a baby before a degree. It was decided (after long discussions behind closed doors) that she would marry Jamie, and they would be happy. The wedding was small, unceremonious at best. She met Jamie’s parents for the first time, stiff people that reminded her of dried up coral. She shook their hands gently, afraid they would break off into pieces if she squeezed too hard. She stood at the altar, staring into Jamie’s eyes, and all she could think about was how her salty tears tasted like the sea.</p>
        <p>Her mother urged her to stop going to school. <em>“The stress is bad for the baby, just wait until he’s born.”</em> Her mother is convinced it’s a boy. Maybe a boy wouldn’t come back with a baby after two years of college. She finds herself unable to think of the gender. Maybe she doesn’t care enough. She decides to think it’s a girl.</p>
        <p>The small room in Jamie’s apartment, once a dingy office, is now a pale blue, filled with toys and supplies her mother continues to throw at her. She thinks the baby might suffocate if she’s given any more diapers. She spends her days wandering the tiny apartment, only coming out of her thoughts when Jamie comes back from class, those pale eyes sunken in from exhaustion.</p>
        <p>She remembers the story of selkies, wonderful creatures that wear a soft seal pelt, becoming human only when their pelt is taken from them. Fishermen, in their greed for beautiful wives, steal selkies’ pelts to prevent them from returning to the sea. How unfair, she thinks, to be one of those selkies; to have a part of their lives taken from them. She sits with the selkies until she can no longer bear being a part of them.</p>
        <p>Her stomach bulges now, making moving anywhere for too long simply too tiring. She feels like a walrus, blubbery and clumsy as she walks on swollen feet. She found out the gender ages ago, a girl. Her mother was heartbroken, but it’s okay, she says, there’s always next time.</p>
        <p>She dreams of soft waves lapping at her feet as the sun shines down on her face, the wind blowing her hair gently as she stares out into the endless ocean. A splash to the right makes her turn her head, as she comes face to face with a small dolphin. It chitters, slapping its fin against the water, splashing waves against her. She finds herself laughing, watching this beautiful pale creature swim around her, feeling its rubbery skin. It’s wonderful, she thinks, as she strokes it, listening to the small clicks emanating from its mouth. Her eyes close, and although she knows this dolphin can’t talk, she hears it anyway: <strong>I love you.</strong></p>
        <p>The water around her warms as she smiles, the bright light of the sun whitening as the wind turns into whispers of voices. Her eyes crack open, squinting against the harsh white light. She sees shadows, figures above her as she adjusts. The sun shuts off as she blinks rapidly, now noticing the small light being held in gloved hands. As she looks around, spotting Jamie’s pale face stricken with fear, she follows his gaze to her legs, feeling wet and sticky. That’s when the pain came back.</p>
        <p>Her labor was long and unexpected, having happened in the middle of the night. Searing hot flashes of pain, like sitting on hot irons, shot through her body as flashes of white coats passed by her vision. It was only when she heard tiny cries over her pained ones that she knew it was over. She sees gloved hands take a bundle in a towel away, and she reaches her arm out weakly: <em>“My baby… give me my baby…”</em> Yet no one heard her, or perhaps she wasn’t able to say anything at all.</p>

        <p>The water warmed, the sun’s light brightening, the wind whispering. She opened her eyes to gloved hands holding a small light, shadows and figures above.

Tiny cries reached her. <span style="background-color: #d0f0ff;">She reached out weakly, whispering, <em>“My baby… give me my baby…”</em></span></p>

      </div>
      <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Throughout the revision process, I focused on improving clarity, pacing, and readability while preserving the emotional impact and key imagery of the story. I broke up long sentences and paragraphs to create smoother flow, particularly in the sections describing her immersion in the sea and early interactions with Jamie. I made small sentence adjustments, like clarifying her bath-time mimicry of sea creatures or the dolphin encounter, to maintain vivid imagery while enhancing comprehension. These changes align with Chien’s emphasis on structured writing to support reader engagement (Chien, 2024) and Gagich’s guidance on refining multimodal composition for rhetorical clarity (Gagich, 2020). At the same time, I preserved the story’s hard-hitting lines, especially the final sentence, ensuring the narrative’s emotional resonance remained intact, as Yancey advocates for maintaining authentic voice and purpose in digital and multimodal writing (Yancey, n.d.). Overall, this moderate revision allowed me to balance clarity, structure, and emotional depth, demonstrating how thoughtful editing can enhance a story without compromising its core impact.</p>
