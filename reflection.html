    <h1>Reflection on the Revision and Portfolio Process</h1>

    <!-- Intro -->

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Reflecting on my journey through the Professional Writing program has allowed me to better understand the value of revision, multimodal composition, and reflective practice. Each stage of this capstone portfolio demonstrates how my skills as a writer, designer, and critical thinker have evolved through both academic and creative projects.

      <h3>Revision and Reflection</h3>
      <div class="reflection-section">
        <p>
          Looking back on my work from the start of the Professional Writing program, I have come to appreciate the value of revision and reflection in developing as a writer. Revisiting earlier essays, creative pieces, and professional projects allowed me to see how my understanding of audience, structure, and voice has evolved. As 
          <a href="https://www.joycerain.com/uploads/2/3/2/0/23207256/kathleenyancey_compositioninanewkey.pdf" target="_blank">Yancey (n.d.)</a> explains, writing today extends beyond words to include digital and multimodal forms of communication, and reflective practices are central to growth as a writer.

      <h3>Building a Digital Portfolio</h3>
      <div class="reflection-section">
        <p>
          Deciding to create a website as the platform for my portfolio was an intentional choice that allowed me to combine both creative and professional skills. Digital portfolios provide a multimodal space to showcase writing in a way that is interactive, visually engaging, and strategically organized for different audiences. As 
          <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364342295_ePortfolios_as_a_platform_for_evidencing_employability_and_building_professional_identity_A_literature_review" target="_blank">Carter (2021)</a> notes, ePortfolios not only allow for self-assessment and reflection but also serve as tools for demonstrating skills and building professional identity.

      <h3>Multimodal Composition and Engagement</h3>
      <div class="reflection-section">
        <p>
          Incorporating multimodal elements into my portfolio—such as PDFs, podcasts, and interactive media—has reinforced the importance of considering audience, accessibility, and design. As 
          <a href="https://www.rtic-journal.com/article/perception-of-multimodal-portfolios-as-a-pedagogical-strategy-for-learning-writing-in-a-digital-13972" target="_blank">Baptista, Pereira, and Toledo (2023)</a> found, multimodal portfolios encourage engagement, creativity, and digital literacy.

      <h3>Professional Outcomes and Personal Branding</h3>
      <div class="reflection-section">
        <p>
          Thinking about professional outcomes was central to my decision to create a website. Research shows that digital portfolios and personal branding can positively influence how potential employers perceive a candidate. As 
          <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02662/full" target="_blank">Gorbatov et al. (2019)</a> explain, proactive personal branding in digital spaces enhances career visibility and perceived employability.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <div class="reflection-section">
        <p>
          Overall, this capstone project has reinforced the significance of revision, reflection, and intentional design. Reviewing past work showed me where I have grown, while creating a digital, multimodal portfolio allowed me to extend my skills into professional and creative arenas simultaneously. It has strengthened my understanding that writing is iterative, multimodal, and deeply connected to audience, purpose, and self-presentation. This portfolio stands as both a record of past learning and a foundation for continued growth.
