    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <section class="intro-section">
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        When I began planning my capstone project, I wanted to create something that would represent the full range of my experiences as a writer throughout the Professional Writing program. Rather than focusing on one specific piece of writing, I wanted a project that could demonstrate how my skills have developed across multiple genres, audiences, and platforms. The personal portfolio website I am building allows me to do exactly that. It brings together my academic, creative, and professional work in one cohesive and multimodal space. While the project is still in progress, the process of designing it has already deepened my understanding of writing as an adaptable, evolving practice.
      </p>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <section class="intro-section">
      <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of my capstone project is to create a professional portfolio that highlights both the versatility and continuity of my writing. I want to showcase my ability to write effectively in a variety of genres, from analytical essays to creative work to professional materials, while also reflecting on how these different modes connect. I chose to create a website because digital spaces offer unique opportunities for multimodal composition. Unlike a traditional print portfolio, a website lets me use design, navigation, and visuals as rhetorical tools. The layout, color scheme, and organization of the site are all part of how I communicate with an audience.

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <section class="intro-section">
      <h2>Revision and Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Although the portfolio is still under construction, I have made significant progress in gathering materials, revising written pieces, and experimenting with design. Reviewing my past work required me to think critically about what each piece demonstrated about my learning and how it contributed to my development as a writer. Revisiting older pieces has been meaningful in recognizing progress. My writing has become more confident and deliberate; arguments are more cohesive, tone more balanced, and attention to audience more precise. Creative work shows growth in conveying emotion and perspective without losing structure or clarity.

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <section class="intro-section">
      <h2>Design Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        Alongside revision, I’ve started exploring the design phase. I am experimenting with layout, typography, and color schemes that reflect both professionalism and creativity. Studying other digital portfolios reminded me that design itself is rhetorical and shapes the way readers experience content. Building the website expanded my understanding of digital literacy and multimodal composition. Being a writer today often means being a designer, editor, and researcher all at once. Applying these overlapping skills has been both challenging and rewarding.

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <section class="intro-section">
      <h2>Next Steps and Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        My next steps will focus on completing website design, writing reflective statements for each section, and refining overall organization. Each piece will include a short commentary explaining its context, purpose, and what it demonstrates about my development. This portfolio represents both an ending and a beginning. It draws together everything I’ve learned about genre, rhetoric, and multimodal writing, while creating something I can continue to build on in the future. Writing is flexible, creative, and constantly evolving, and this portfolio celebrates that understanding.
