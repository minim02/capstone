      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This section presents examples of my academic writing throughout the Professional Writing program. Included are both original and revised versions of my work, alongside
        a reflection on the revision process that showcases my growth as a writer and researcher.

    <!-- Original Draft -->
    <section class="bib-source">
      <h3>Original Draft</h3>
      <p>
        This initial draft came from an Advanced Composition class, where we were required to research a topic that had a subculture surrounding it. I wrote my paper on geocaching, a hobby where people follow hints to find small boxes hidden by others. After finding them, they usually sign a logbook and place it back where it was.

      <h3>Reflection on Revision</h3>
      <div class="academic-section">
        <p>
          I focused on making the “Methods” section more detailed, analytical, and structured. The original version briefly listed the research techniques, but it didn’t fully explain how or why each method contributed to the project. I expanded it into a multi-paragraph section that clarifies the purpose, process, and significance of each research step; interviewing, field observation, digital exploration, and secondary source review. I also added transitional and interpretive sentences to make the essay flow more smoothly between sections. Beyond the methods, I made small stylistic and organizational changes throughout the essay to enhance clarity, emphasize reflection, and show deeper understanding of geocaching as a cultural phenomenon. These revisions strengthen the essay’s academic tone, improve coherence, and demonstrate critical thinking while still preserving the original voice and content.
