    <h1>Annotated Bibliography</h1>

    <section class="bib-intro">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This annotated bibliography supports my project on creating a multimodal digital portfolio that showcases my growth as a writer while integrating creative, professional, and academic dimensions.
        My research approach focused on locating sources that address digital portfolios, multimodal composition, revision processes, and the intersection of writing with professional identity and personal branding.
        Through this research, I learned how reflective practices, revision, and audience-conscious design are critical for conveying both learning and identity.
        These sources collectively inform my project by offering frameworks for constructing a portfolio that is not only a record of my work but also a curated representation of my evolving skills, self-presentation, and engagement with contemporary digital composing practices.
